## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

* You should use xCode 16 and iOS 18 or higher to use that package, don't forget to setup the [cocoapods](./example/ios/Podfile) correctly too.

* You should add the keys to the [Info.plist](./example/ios/Runner/Info.plist) of the iOS app to make it work. ‚ö†Ô∏è **If you miss the required key the app will crash when you show the picker** ‚ö†Ô∏è 
  * ALWAYS: (Bluetooth or WiFi, or both)
  ```
  <key>NSAccessorySetupKitSupports</key>
  <array>
    <string>Bluetooth</string>
    <string>WiFi</string>
  </array>
  ```
  * when you use the ``ASDiscoveryDescriptor`` with ``bluetoothServiceUUID``
  ‚ö†Ô∏è **The UUID string must be upper-cased here** ‚ö†Ô∏è
  ```
  <key>NSAccessorySetupBluetoothServices</key>
  <array>
    <string>149E9E42-33AD-41AD-8665-70D153533EC1</string>
  </array>
  ```
  * when you use the ``ASDiscoveryDescriptor`` with ``bluetoothNameSubstring``
  ‚ö†Ô∏è **Does not work in the iOS 18 Developer beta 2** ‚ö†Ô∏è 
  ```
  <key>NSAccessorySetupBluetoothNames</key>
  <array>
    <string>DeviceName</string>
  </array>
  ```
  * there is an option with manufacturer ID that is not covered here



* Use the FlutterAccessorysetup class. See the full code example in the [Example app](./example/lib/main.dart) 

```
    final _flutterAccessorysetupPlugin = FlutterAccessorysetup();

    _flutterAccessorysetupPlugin.sessionStream.listen((event) => setState(() {
        // handle session events here
        // async errors will be delivered as session events too
    }

    try {
      await _flutterAccessorysetupPlugin.activate();
      await _flutterAccessorysetupPlugin.showPicker();
    } on PlatformException {
      debugPrint('Failed to show the picker');
    }
```

## üßë‚Äçü¶Ø Know how

‚ö†Ô∏è The AccessorySetup does not work on the Simulator ‚ö†Ô∏è 

* When user close the Picker by tapping cross button, the showPicker closure emits an error (ASErrorDomain, code 700)

* If the device have been connected previously, it will be in the ``session.accessories`` array right after the session was activated event. 
‚ö†Ô∏è **This device will not discoverable by Setup Picker until the User disconnects it from the settings** ‚ö†Ô∏è

* When the User selects the device using picker, 
  * the device will be displayed in the `MyDevices` section of the `Settings/Bluetooth` screen
  * the device's `info screen` will display image and name you provided to the descriptor during the discovery process (the same that user see in the picker)

## ‚úÖ TODO

next steps:

- [v] update the documentation to note all required steps and limitations of the AccessorySetupKit

- [v] introduce customization for the device discovery:
* name
* image
* custom services UUID

- [ ] find a way to work with the Flutter ble package (setup kit gives the Peripheral ID which the app ble should work with)
* investigate what is the Ble package we use in Flutter in the company
* implement handling the discovered Ble device using that package.

- [ ] introduce unit tests

- [ ] implement wifi setup

- [ ] check the migration sequence and implementation in Flutter (for example app)
