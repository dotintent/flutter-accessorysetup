# Flutter Accessory Kit

At this stage the library supports:

- [x] BLE
- [ ] WiFi (work in progress)
- [ ] Migration

‚ÄºÔ∏è One important remark: by Apple's design, the library works only with **iOS 18 or above**. ‚ÄºÔ∏è

## üöá How to use

Install the library using the command line:

```sh
flutter pub get TBD
```

### ‚öôÔ∏è Setup

- You should add the keys to the [Info.plist](./example/ios/Runner/Info.plist) of the iOS app to make it work.
  ‚ö†Ô∏è **If you miss the required key the app will crash when you show the picker.** ‚ö†Ô∏è

  - ALWAYS: (Bluetooth or WiFi, or both)

  ```xml
  <key>NSAccessorySetupKitSupports</key>
  <array>
    <string>Bluetooth</string>
    <string>WiFi</string>
  </array>
  ```

  - When you use the `ASDiscoveryDescriptor` with `bluetoothServiceUUID`  
    ‚ö†Ô∏è **The UUID string must be upper-cased here.** ‚ö†Ô∏è

  ```xml
  <key>NSAccessorySetupBluetoothServices</key>
  <array>
    <string>149E9E42-33AD-41AD-8665-70D153533EC1</string>
  </array>
  ```

  - When you use the `ASDiscoveryDescriptor` with `bluetoothNameSubstring`  
    ‚ö†Ô∏è **Does not work in the iOS 18 Developer beta 2.** ‚ö†Ô∏è

  ```xml
  <key>NSAccessorySetupBluetoothNames</key>
  <array>
    <string>DeviceName</string>
  </array>
  ```

  - There is an option with manufacturer ID that is not covered here.

- Use the `FlutterAccessorysetup` class. See the full code example in the [Example app](./example/lib/main.dart)

```dart
final _flutterAccessorysetupPlugin = FlutterAccessorysetup();

_flutterAccessorysetupPlugin.sessionStream.listen((event) => setState(() {
    // handle session events here
    // async errors will be delivered as session events too
}));

try {
  await _flutterAccessorysetupPlugin.activate();
  await _flutterAccessorysetupPlugin.showPicker();
} on PlatformException {
  debugPrint('Failed to show the picker');
}
```

## ‚ÑπÔ∏è What we know

‚ö†Ô∏è The AccessorySetup does not work on the Simulator. ‚ö†Ô∏è

- When the user closes the Picker by tapping the cross button, the `showPicker` closure emits an error (ASErrorDomain, code 700).

- ‚ö†Ô∏è **When the person picks a BLE accessory, the picker sends an event of type `ASAccessoryEventType.accessoryChanged`. It might be that the picker sends an event of type `ASAccessoryEventType.accessoryAdded`, but I can't reproduce it at all.** ‚ö†Ô∏è

- If the device has been connected previously, it will be in the `session.accessories` array right after the session is activated.  
  ‚ö†Ô∏è **This device will not be discoverable by the Setup Picker until the user disconnects it from the settings.** ‚ö†Ô∏è

- When the user selects the device using the picker:
  - The device will be displayed in the `My Devices` section of the `Settings/Bluetooth` screen.
  - The device's info screen will display the image and name you provided to the `ASPickerDisplayItem` during the discovery process (the same that the user saw in the picker).

- When the user deletes the app, the device will be disconnected automatically. It won't be displayed in the `My Devices` section of the `Settings/Bluetooth` screen anymore.
